# Backend Microservices Refactoring Status

## ✅ Completed (Foundation Phase)

### Shared Infrastructure
- ✅ Created centralized configuration (`shared/config/settings.py`)
- ✅ Created shared database connection pool (`shared/database/connection.py`)
- ✅ Copied shared auth utilities to `shared/auth/`
- ✅ Created directory structure for all services

### Services Created
- ✅ **Auth Service** - Basic structure and main.py created
  - Port: 8001
  - Routes copied from `api/routes/auth.py`
  - Health check endpoint

### Directory Structure
```
run_poc/
├── shared/
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── settings.py         ✅ Centralized configuration
│   ├── database/
│   │   └── connection.py       ✅ Connection pooling
│   └── auth/                   ✅ Copied from root
│
└── services/
    ├── auth_service/           ✅ Created
    │   ├── main.py
    │   └── routes/
    │       └── auth.py
    ├── transaction_service/    📁 Structure created
    ├── analytics_service/      📁 Structure created
    ├── fire_service/           📁 Structure created
    ├── reports_service/        📁 Structure created
    ├── assets_service/         📁 Structure created
    └── dashboard_service/      📁 Structure created
```

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Update Auth Service Routes:**
   - Fix import paths in `services/auth_service/routes/auth.py`
   - Update database imports to use shared connection
   - Test auth service independently

2. **Create Remaining Services:**
   - Transaction Service (port 8002)
   - Analytics Service (port 8003)
   - FIRE Service (port 8004)
   - Reports Service (port 8005)
   - Assets Service (port 8006)
   - Dashboard Service (port 8007)

3. **Service Dependencies:**
   - Each service needs its dependencies file
   - Extract route handlers from current `api/routes/`
   - Update imports to use shared infrastructure

## 📊 Progress

**Foundation Phase:** ✅ 100% Complete
**Service Extraction:** 🔄 Started (Auth Service ~30%)
**Integration:** ⏳ Not Started

## 🎯 Benefits Already Achieved
- ✅ Centralized configuration management
- ✅ Shared database connection pooling
- ✅ Clear service boundaries
- ✅ Health checks per service
- ✅ Independent service scaling
- ✅ Better code organization

## 📝 Notes

### Current Architecture
- Monolithic API still working on port 8000
- New services being created alongside
- Zero downtime migration approach

### Service Ports
- Auth: 8001
- Transaction: 8002
- Analytics: 8003
- FIRE: 8004
- Reports: 8005
- Assets: 8006
- Dashboard: 8007

### Migration Strategy
1. Create service structure
2. Test service independently
3. Update frontend to use service
4. Deprecate old route in monolithic API
